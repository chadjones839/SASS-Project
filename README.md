# Learning SCSS 

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn the basics of SCSS via an online video course through udemy.com

While working on other large-scale projects, I've occasionally needed to create more complex styles. By researching how others have coded similar tasks through sites like codepen and codesandbox, It was clear that SCSS would be a valuable skill to learn.

## Description 

The course provided starting html files. I wrote all the styling as the course instructed, while also including my own notes.
